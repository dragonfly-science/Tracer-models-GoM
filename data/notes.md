From Jim:

In brief, the team realized that we only had really good abundance and SI/FA data for 3 predator species at our 2 locations of interest in our time frame of interest, and then need to utilize prey FA/SI from earlier sampling to fill that in.

We are still working to determine the exact composition of the species/groups that we will be using in the EwE model, so I don;t know what our diet matrix will look like yet. Once we have that figured out I suspect we will need to have a discussion about how we integrate variability for the prey items that are not included in the the FastInR output.

If you have any questions about the data,or data structure, your best bet would be to email Jill directly, but please copy me so I can keep an archive in case there are questions as we are writing the manuscript.

From Jill:

Please find attached the compiled stable isotope + fatty acid data for the three focal species for mixing model analysis. I have set up (1) predator and (2) prey spreadsheets for each pair. The headings are consistent among sheets. Data include temporal, spatial, functional, species, size (when applicable) and tracer information for PS5, PS7 and WHP1 from 2016. 

 

For many prey species our sampling was limited to 2015 rather than 2016. I have included these groups (e.g., infauna) in the sheets and are designated as such. I attempted to capture this on the SUMMARY tab.
